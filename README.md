# Working with Pandas in Python  
This notebook provides a hands-on introduction to data analysis in Python using the **pandas** library. It covers the essentials of working with DataFrames and Series, loading data from files (CSV, Excel), cleaning and transforming datasets, filtering rows and columns, handling missing values, and performing basic aggregations and visualizations.

Designed for beginners, it's perfect for anyone starting their journey in data science, data analysis, or automation with Python. All examples run directly in Jupyter Notebook, allowing you to experiment interactively and build confidence step by step.
